# ODSC West 2018 Materials for Stanned Up: Bayesian Methods using Stan

We will be using R, Rstudio, the tidyverse, and Stan via the rstan and brms libraries.

If you want to following along on your own machine, please install the following software before the workshop.

1. R: https://cloud.r-project.org
2. RStudio: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
3. The rstan package: https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started
4. The brms package: https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms
5. The tidyverse suite of packages: `install.packages("tidyverse")` at the R console.

Please check back here the week before the conference and we may have ready to use code available so that you won't have to type everything in during the workshop.

Thank you for considering coming to this workshop. We are interested in hearing your stories regarding how you are using Stan and Bayesian methods in business.
