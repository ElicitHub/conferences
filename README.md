# ODSC West 2018 Materials for Stanned Up: Bayesian Methods using Stan

## Prerequisites

We will be using R, Rstudio, the tidyverse, and Stan via the rstan and brms libraries. Someone who has been introduced to Bayesian inference, has some R and regression background, but doesn't know where to start is the ideal candidate for this workshop. 

If you want to follow along on your machine during the workshop, please install the following software beforehand.

1. R: https://cloud.r-project.org
2. RStudio: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
3. The rstan package: https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started
4. The brms package: https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms
5. The tidyverse suite of packages: `install.packages("tidyverse")` at the R console.

Please check back here the week before the conference and we may have ready to use code available so that you won't have to type everything in during the workshop.

Thank you for considering coming to this workshop. We are interested in hearing your stories regarding how you are using Stan and Bayesian methods in business.
